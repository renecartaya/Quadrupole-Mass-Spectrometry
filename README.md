# Quadrupole-Mass-Spectrometry

This repository aims to implement Signal Processing of Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry data from Cross-beam ion sources used to study electron-beam-induced chemical processes in thin films, single molecules, and clusters to develop new materials.

For this purposes, the codes are developed, mainly in Python R. And allow us to analyze different experimental processes such as:

 1) Electron Stimulated Desorption (ESD)
 2) Thermal Stimulated Desorption (TSD)
 3) Cross-section (as a function of Electron Energy)
 4) Mass spectra identifying the peak positions

The developed codes works reading files in .csv, .txt and .asc format files.
