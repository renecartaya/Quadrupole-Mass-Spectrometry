# Quadrupole-Mass-Spectrometry

Repository dedicated to the Signal Processing of Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry data from Cross-beam ion sources used for the study of electron-beam induced chemical processes in thin-films, single molecules and clusters for the development of new materials.

For this purposes the codes are developed, mainly in Python R. And allow us to analyze different experimental process such as:

 1) Electron Stimulated Desorption (ESD).
 2) Thermal Stimulated Desorption (TSD).
 3) Cross section (as function of Electron Energy).
 4) Mass spectra identifying the peak positions.

The developed codes works reading files in .csv, .txt and .asc format files.
